The hollow path curved past the old orchard, where the hollow trees creaked in the wind and the orchard soil felt soft underfoot. A single ember drifted upward from a small fire near the stone cairn, and that ember glowed brighter as the wind picked up. Beyond the cairn stood a quiet lattice of branches forming a loose shelter, and beneath that lattice someone had left an old satchel covered in dust. The satchel held a small rune carved into wood, the same rune that marked the hollow trailhead at the edge of the orchard.
